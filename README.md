# King Sukh Guest House – Website Redesign  
**Internship Project | Innobyte Services Pvt. Ltd.**

## Introduction

This project was part of my internship at **Innobyte Services Pvt. Ltd.**, where I redesigned the website for **King Sukh Guest House** — a peaceful retreat nestled in nature.  
The goal was to transform the existing static site into a more modern, responsive, and user-friendly platform.
